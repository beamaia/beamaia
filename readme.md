### Hello there from Brazil! 😁 I'm Bea, an aspiring data scientist 📊

I work at [Vert Soluções em TI]([https://www.vert.com.br/), with data integration related tasks, from the ETL process to the creation of dashboards. A normal day at work includes either creating dashboards with SAS Visual Analytics, cleaning up and manipulating data with SAS and Python, scraping the web or fraud detection with SAS Visual Investigator. I'm also a part of the Bio-Inspired Lab at UFES, studying image classification with CNNs, specifically skin and oral cancer related. A computer science undergraduate at the Federal University of Espírito Santo and a big Python fangirl. 

I'm still trying to juggle school and work, but when I can, I like to develop data driven projects. Other than that, I like playing Civilization 6, Cities Skyline and the Sims. Thanks for stopping by 😊 Down low are some of my stats and some repositories that I like.
