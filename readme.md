### Hello there from Brazil! 😁 I'm Bea, machine learning engineer with a focus on LLMs and image classification 📊

I'm currently working at [Weni](https://weni.ai/en/) as a Machine Learning Engineer, with a focus on LLMs and chatbots. I'm also a part of the Bio-Inspired Lab at UFES, studying image classification with CNNs and image generation with VAE, specifically skin and oral cancer related. I'm also a computer science undergraduate at the Federal University of Espírito Santo, class of 2024/1 🤞

I'm interested in many topics related to deep learning. Here are some topics that I'm mostly interested in:
- Quantization of large models (specially LLMs) -> Deploying large models with faster reponse time
- Training models with multiple GPUs (in a love and hate relationship with CUDA and Accelerate)
- Increasing projects' MLOps maturity. Tracking experiments, automating training and deploying mdoels
- Hyperparameter search for different type of neural networks
- Creating better classification system for cancer image to help out pathologyst and doctors

I'm still trying to juggle school and work, while navigating life with fibromyalgia. Other than that, I like playing Civilization 6, Cities Skyline and The Sims when there's any free time. Work-life-heath balance 😁 Thanks for stopping by 😊 Down low are some of my stats and some repositories that I like. Add me on [linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/beamaia/) and let's chat about machine learning!
