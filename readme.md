### Hello there from Brazil! 😁 I'm Bea, an aspiring machine learning engineer 📊

I'm currently working at [Weni]([https://www.eldorado.org.br/en/](https://weni.ai/en/)) as a Machine Learning Engineer.  I'm also a part of the Bio-Inspired Lab at UFES, studying image classification with CNNs, specifically skin and oral cancer related. A computer science undergraduate at the Federal University of Espírito Santo and a big Python fangirl. 

I'm still trying to juggle school and work, but when I can, I like to develop data-driven projects. Other than that, I like playing Civilization 6, Cities Skyline and The Sims. Thanks for stopping by 😊 Down low are some of my stats and some repositories that I like.
