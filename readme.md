### Hello there from Brazil! 😁 I'm Bea, Machine Learning Engineer with a focus on LLMs and image classification

I'm a Machine Learning Engineer, with a focus on LLMs and chatbots. When I'm not working, I'm a part of the Bio-Inspired Lab at UFES, studying image classification with CNNs, specifically skin and oral cancer related. I'm also a computer science undergraduate at the Federal University of Espírito Santo, class of 2025/2 🤞

I'm interested in many topics related to deep learning. Here are some topics that I'm mostly interested in:
- Increasing projects' MLOps maturity. Tracking experiments, automating training and deploying mdoels
- Creating AI Agents to accelerate tedious and repetitive tasks
- Hyperparameter search for different type of neural networks
- Creating better classification and detection systems for cancer image to help out pathologyst and doctors

I'm still trying to juggle school and work, while navigating life with fibromyalgia. Other than that, I like watching Korean and Chinese Dramas or doing pilates when there's any free time. Work-life-heath balance 😁 The cat in my header is my lil' kitten Mei. There's also places that I love in Brazil, anything green or near the ocean 🌊

I'm also interested in research! Check out an article that I published under Bio-Inspired Lab: ["Transformers, convolutional neural networks, and few-shot learning for classification of histopathological images of oral cancer"](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0957417423029202) 💻 Let's chat about deep learning!
