### Hello there! I'm Bea — AI Engineer & Researcher 🇧🇷🇺🇸

I am an AI Engineer currently contracted to Grupo Boticário (via Cadastra), where I architect Generative AI systems and LLM Orchestration layers. My profile is a mix of academic research and practical engineering. I stay current with the latest AI literature and peer-review papers in my free time to ensure the systems I build are based on grounded, reliable methods. I believe a theoretical base is essential for building sturdy applications, specially when dealing with open-source tools.

### 🛠️ Technical Focus
- **Generative AI:** LLM Orchestration, RAG, and building autonomous **Agentic AI** (using Agno, CrewAI, LangChain).
- **Computer Vision & NLP:** Deep experience with **Transformers, YOLO, and CNNs** in PyTorch for both text and image classification.
- **MLOps & Fullstack:** Constructing robust **FastAPI** backends and managing cloud infrastructure on **AWS/GCP**.
- **Academic Research:** Contributed to the **Bio-Inspired Lab (UFES)** with a focus on Few-Shot Learning and medical imaging (digital pathology).

### 🔬 Featured Research
I'm also interested in research! Check out an article that I published under Bio-Inspired Lab (I hope to in the future to be able to publish more):
- 📄 ["Transformers, convolutional neural networks, and few-shot learning for classification of histopathological images of oral cancer"](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0957417423029202).

### 🌱 Personal & Soft Skills
- **Bilingual & Multicultural:** I was raised in both **Brazil and the United States**, being able to speak fluent in both tongues.
- **Advocacy:** Navigating life with fibromyalgia and chronic fatigue, I am a proponent of work-life-health balance and advocate to those around me about what's it like to live with an invisible disability. Afterall, while it's tough, being disable hasn't stopped me from going after my dreams. 
- **Interests:** When I'm not coding, I'm watching Asian Dramas, walking near the beach, or hanging out with my forever kitten, Mei 🐈.
